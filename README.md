# Pareto-UPR-Feedback-Control
Python scripts used to simulate the model and calculate Pareto sets from paper "How to design an optimal sensor network for the unfolded protein response" [Mol Biol Cell 29 (2018), 3052-3062]. All codes were run using Python, version 2.7.
This code was originally created by Wylie Stroberg.  For more information, we recommend to read the paper on: https://www.molbiolcell.org/doi/10.1091/mbc.E18-01-0060
